 galactic_features.101.desc:0 "We have discovered a primitive mammalian culture on [primitive_civ.Capital.GetName]. The most advanced regions on the planet have only recently advanced beyond the Iron Age, and much of the surface is ruled by feudal nobles who vie with each other in an endless struggle for titles and land."
 galactic_features.102.desc:0 "A primitive industrial culture is currently locked in a global war on the surface of [primitive_civ.Capital.GetName]. Two large alliances of nation states are fighting each other with massive numbers of armored land vehicles, atmospheric aircraft and ocean-going naval vessels. Some of these states are on the cusp of unlocking atomic power, which could radically increase the destructive potential of this conflict."
 galactic_features.103.desc:0 "[primitive_civ.Capital.GetName] is home to a mammalian civilization currently in an Early Space Age. The orbital space around the planet is cluttered with primitive satellites, and the natives seem to have already launched several manned missions to Sol IIIa. A number of small sublight exploration probes have been detected on outbound trajectories towards other bodies within the system."

 anomaly.5003.desc:0 "Finally! Well met, spacefarer! We are the Dathnak, and the planet you are orbiting is Tollok Rong - our ancestral home. It is always riveting to meet a solid, even if our last encounter with your kind was somewhat... problematic.\n\nYou have no doubt detected the radiation surges coming from our atmosphere. Tollok Rong is dying, and our species will perish unless we find a new home. We have identified a few planets that would suit our physiology, but we have no means to get there. Sadly, our non-corporeal nature means we don't have much in the way of industry or technology. Will you help us to any one of them?"
 anomaly.5007.desc:0 "Hello again! You will be pleased to learn that our species has quadrupled in number since we arrived! Many of us were swept up in a festive mood when we made planetfall, and things got a bit frisky to say the least.\n\nAfter the positive experience we had colonizing Baldarak, a few brave pioneers have asked me to petition you for passage to another gas giant - another destination candidate of our initial relocation operation. What do you say, friends?"

 nomad.41.a.tooltip:0 "Creates a §YNamarian§! empire with §B3 £pops  Pops§! on §H[NomadMissionPlanet.GetName]§! and transfers control of §H[NomadMissionPlanet.System.GetName]§! system to the new empire.\n\nYour relation with the §Y[nomad_fleet_country.GetName]§! and the §YNamarian§! empire is §Gimproved§!\n\n"

 primitive.180.desc:0 "Greetings. You have no doubt taken note of our ascent from humble beginnings, just as we have taken note of your $fleet_type_shipclass_starbase$ orbiting our star. We understand that this $fleet_type_shipclass_starbase$ represents some hypothetical claim on this system.\n\nWe ask only that you relinquish this hold on our space, ceding the $fleet_type_shipclass_starbase$ to the beings who have called [From.Capital.GetStarName] home since time immemorial.\n\nIt is only just.\n\nOh, and all planets in this system, too."
 primitive.180.b.tooltip:0 "We'd better back these words up with force."
