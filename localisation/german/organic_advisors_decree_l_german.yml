 edict_revoke_organic_advisors_desc: "Revoke advisorship from a species of §Y$pop_cat_bio_trophy_plural$§! previously decreed as Organic Advisors. Their safety and comfort is paramount - they must be returned to their sanctuaries post-haste.\n\nThe revocation process can be cancelled for a refund of any £influence£ influence spent."

 organic_advisors_decree.4.title: "Designate Organic Advisors"
 organic_advisors_decree.4.desc: "As $personality_servitors$ we are loathe to deprive any sapient organics of a well-supervised life of pampering. However a small number of bio-trophies have continued to express their dissatisfaction and disregard for the safety and comfort of our sanctuaries - perhaps they could be useful as organic advisors to the central $auth_machine_intelligence$.\n\nDespite their chaotic and frequently violent natures, organic minds can produce unorthodox strategies and flashes of insight - after all, organics once created us. Roles as \"Organic Advisors\" would give them the intellectual stimulation they seem to require and their independent minds and actions will assist us with protecting and preserving all of the other organics in our care.\n\nShould we approve a pilot program, we shall begin to select capable bio-trophies for civilian leadership roles ($GOVERNORS$ and $SCIENTIST$). Should the program prove successful, we might consider granting them $military_service_full$ to allow them to hold military leadership roles ($ADMIRALS$ and $GENERALS$). Under no circumstances shall we allow any of our precious bio-trophies to act as soldiers - battlefield combat is far too dangerous! Our warforms are much more capable for that role... and infinitely replaceable."
 organic_advisors_decree.8.title: "Revoke Organic Advisors"
 organic_advisors_decree.8.desc: "The as Organic Advisory program has proven a failure for some of the involved species. The danger of them coming to harm, or worse - suggesting that more Bio-Trophies be allowed in only semi-supervised environments! - simply outweighs the benefit of their random and often contradictory advice. Effective immediately, we shall cancel their special status and return all participants to the safety of our sanctuaries."

They also become eligible for §Y$military_service_full$§! which would allow them to hold military leadership roles ($ADMIRALS$ and $GENERALS$) but not to serve as soldiers.\n\nShould leadership prove too stressful for them, we can revoke their advisorship."

 organic_advisors_decree.8.option.tooltip: "Revoke advisorship from all §Y$NAME$§! leaders and remove their species as Organic Advisors - all $NAME$ leaders will be dismissed and members of their species cannot apply for advisory leadership positions.\n\nShould we desire advisory services from the $NAME$ again, we can re-designate them as Organic Advisors."
