#mod created by RoverStorm
#
#This mod is designed as a temporary fix for various bugs discovered that are minimal effort to fix.
#It does not change anything in the base game except particular core files that are impossible to fix without overriding.
#If you find a bug, feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to fix it.
#
#When Paradox launches their actual patch, this mod will remove any files that they fixed.
#
#I will keep this updated as I discover bugs, or am informed to them, so there may still be a reason to stay subscribed!
