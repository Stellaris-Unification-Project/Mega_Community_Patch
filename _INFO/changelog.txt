v1

Initial Release

v2

General
- Research Federations now grant +20% Diplomatic Weight from Technology per Member (excluding themselves), mimicking the effect of manual Research Agreements
- Fleet Contribution: Now grants +20/40/60% Diplomatic weight from Fleet Power for the Federation President

UI
- Added Tooltips to the Modifiers added by this mod, explaining where they come from and how they scale.

Note: Unlike Research Agreements from Research Federations, the game already counts Free Migration Federation Law as proper Migration Treaties that do apply Diplomatic Weight.

v3

General
- Rebuilt and updated to make use of the new variable features that were introduced in 3.1. This should make the code a lot more efficient, and opens room for future additions. A small negative side effect of the new implementation is that Modifier Names cannot contain the number of Pacts that a player has.

Bugfixes:
- Diplomatic Weight from Fleet Contribution is now properly applied to the Leaders of all federations, not just the Default Type.
